To successfully execute bank transfers using our endpoints, it is necessary to undergo the following steps:

<Steps titleSize="p">
  <Step title="Perform a bank account lookup">
    Before initiating bank transfers, it's advisable to inform your customers about the recipient. The bank account lookup endpoint requires an `accountNumber` and the associated `bankCode` (a unique code representing the bank) as input.

    `Request`

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.nomba.com/v1/transfers/bank/lookup \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'accountId: <accountid>' \
        --data '{
        "accountNumber": "0554772814",
        "bankCode": "053"
    }'
    ```

    `Response`

    ```json
    {
        "code": "00",
        "description": "Success",
        "data": {
            "accountNumber": "0554772814",
            "accountName": "M.A Animashaun"
        }
    }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Perform a bank transfer">
    Initiate a bank transfer from Nomba to an external bank. This endpoint requires details such as the `amount` to be transferred, a `merchantTxRef` for later transaction reconciliation, as well as the recipient's `accountNumber` and `bankCode`.

    `Request`

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.nomba.com/v1/transfers/bank \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'accountId: <accountid>' \
        --data '{
        "amount": 3500,
        "accountNumber": "0554772814",
        "accountName": "M.A Animashaun",
        "bankCode": "058",
        "merchantTxRef": "UNQ_123abGGhh5546",
        "senderName": "Nightly Post"
        }'
    ```

        "code": "00",
        "description": "Success",
        "data": {
