## Charge a Tokenized Card

Recurring or subscription payments can be processed using the `tokenKey` generated when a customer’s card was tokenized during checkout.  
This allows you to charge the customer securely without asking for card details again.

<Tip>
  Only include `tokenizeCard: true` when creating a checkout order if you intend to use the customer’s card for future payments. The returned `tokenKey` from the webhook will then be required for recurring charges.

<Tip> 
  Always verify the transaction after charging a tokenized card. You can use webhooks for instant notifications, but it is best practice to confirm the status via the [Verify Transactions](v2/products/checkout/verify-transactions) endpoint before providing value to your customers.
