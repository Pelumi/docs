### Adding a team member

Adding a team member is a simple process. Navigate to the teams section in the menu on the left pane of your Nomba dashboard to send an invitation to a colleague. After sending the invite, your colleague will receive it via email and can accept it to automatically join your team, following necessary validations. You can invite a user with different roles such as ADMIN, IT/Developer, Accountant, etc. The permissions they gain within your business will adjust automatically based on the roles assigned.
