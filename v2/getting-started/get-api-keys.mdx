## Adding a team member

You can invite colleagues to collaborate on your Nomba dashboard.  

1. Go to the **Teams** section in the left menu and click on add team member.  
2. Enter your colleague’s email address and send the invitation.  
3. The invitee will receive an email and can accept it to join your team.  

Each member can be assigned a role with specific permissions:  

- **Owner** – Full access, including account and billing management.  
- **Super Admin** – Full access to resources and settings, a Super Administrator has unrestricted access to all current and future accounts under this business. Assign this role with caution, as it grants complete control.
- **IT/Developer** – Access to API keys, integrations, and technical resources.  
- **Unassigned User** – Limited access until a role is assigned.  

This role-based access ensures each team member only has the permissions necessary for their responsibilities.
