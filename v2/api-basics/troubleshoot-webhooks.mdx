## Get Deliver Logs
Nomba offers a smooth method for tracking down or debugging earlier webhooks that were sent to your system. The URL or event type of webhooks sent within a given timeframe can be obtained by querying the event log API if you wish to verify whether a webhook was actually sent to your system. When a problem occurs and you need to go back and confirm that you have received notifications of all payment events via webhooks, this can be helpful.

To do this, send a `POST`request to this``; this will return a detailed list of events that have been sent to your system.

See a sample request and response data below:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl --request POST \ 
--url https://api.nomba.com/v1/webhooks/event-logs \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'accountId: <accountid>' \
--data '{
        "coreUserId": "6703XXXd1-158a-42XX-8f0b-XXXXXXXXX",
        "limit": 1,
        "eventType": "payment_success",
        "startDateTime": "2025-03-03",
        "endDateTime": "2025-03-12"
   }'
```
```json Response
{
    "code": "200",
    "description": "Webhook events fetched successfully",
    "data": {
        "list": [
            {
                "webhookUrl": "https://hip-namsj.preme.ngrok-free.app/api/v1/nomba-hook",
                "eventId": 257,
                "eventType": "payment_success",
                "hookRequestId": "ff99274c-58f7-4da4-b20f-XXXXXXXX",
                "responsePayload": "This URL has no default content configured. <a href=\"https://webhook.site/#!/edit/7604-6372-41ee-8f89-d28b8d21944b\">Change response in Webhook.site</a>.",
                "responseHttpStatus": 200
            },
        ],
        "pageToken": "MjEyOTY3MThzM2NyM3Q="
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Repush

After carefully reviewing the webhook via the event log API, you may want to do a single webhook repush or bulk repush; this will trigger a resend of the event back to your system.

To do a repush, send a `POST` request to `v1/webhooks/re-push`, copy the `hooksRequestId` of the event to repush from the event log list, and pass it as the request payload.

See a sample request and response data below:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl --request POST \ 
--url https://api.nomba.com/v1/webhooks/re-push \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'accountId: <accountId>'\
--data '{
    "hooksRequestId": "6703XXXd1-158a-42XX-8f0b-XXXXXXXXX"
  }'
```

```json Success response
{
  "code": "200",
  "description": "Webhooks message re-pushed successfully"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Bulk Repush

Trigger a bulk webhook repush by passing an array of `hooksRequestIds` selected from your delivery logs. 

See a sample request and response data below:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl --request POST \ 
--url https://api.nomba.com/v1/webhooks/bulk-re-push \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'accountId: <accountId>' \
--data '{
    "hooksRequestIds": [
      "6703XXXd1-158a-42XX-8f0b-XXXXXXXXX",
      "703XXXd1-158a-42XX-8f0b-XXXXXXXXX",
      "8703XXXd1-158a-42XX-8f0b-XXXXXXXXX"
    ]
  }'
```

```json Success response
{
    "code": "200",
    "description": "Webhook events bulk re-pushed successfully"
}
```
</CodeGroup>



## Webhook Events

You can also query all events that were sent to your system.

See a sample request and response data below:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl --request POST \ 
--url https://api.nomba.com/v1/webhooks/events \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'accountId: <accountId>'\
--data '{
    "coreUserId": "6703XXXd1-158a-42XX-8f0b-XXXXXXXXX",
    "limit": 20
  }'
```

```json Success
{
    "code": "200",
    "description": "Webhook events fetched successfully",
    "data": {
        "list": [
            {
                "webHookId": 782,
                "eventURL": "https://hip-guinea-supr.net",
                "description": "new",
                "eventType": "order_success",
                "enabled": true
            },
            {
                "webHookId": 257,
                "eventURL": "https://hip-guinea-supr.net",
                "description": "new",
                "eventType": "payment_success",
                "enabled": true
            }
        ],
        "pageToken": ""
    }
}
```
