## Overview

The Refund API allows you to return funds to your customers for completed checkout transactions. You can process full refunds, partial refunds, or refund directly to a customer's bank account via transfer.

<Warning>
  This API is only available in the **production environment**
</Warning>

## Refund Types

The Nomba API supports three types of refunds depending on the parameters you provide:

### 1. Full Refund

When you provide only the `transactionId`, the system automatically processes a **full refund** for the entire transaction amount.

```json
{
  "transactionId": "WEB-ONLINE_C-69923-2e102708-ee34-4a29-b713-a826ca928a12"
}
```

### 2. Partial Refund

To refund a portion of the transaction amount, include the `amount` parameter alongside the `transactionId`. The amount must be less than the original transaction amount.

```json
{
  "transactionId": "WEB-ONLINE_C-69923-2e102708-ee34-4a29-b713-a826ca928a12",
  "amount": 5000.00
}
```

### 3. Refund via Bank Transfer

For instant refunds or when card refunds are not supported, you can refund directly to the customer's bank account by providing `accountNumber` and `bankCode`.

```json
{
  "transactionId": "WEB-ONLINE_C-69923-2e102708-ee34-4a29-b713-a826ca928a12",
  "accountNumber": "0123456789",
  "bankCode": "058"
}
```

<Tip>
  You can combine the transfer method with partial refunds by including the `amount` parameter
</Tip>

## Process a Refund

To process a refund, send a [POST request](/nomba-api-reference/online-checkout/refund-checkout-transaction) to `/v1/checkout/refund`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Full Refund Request
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.nomba.com/v1/checkout/refund \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'accountId: <accountid>' \
      --data '{
        "transactionId": "WEB-ONLINE_C-69923-2e102708-ee34-4a29-b713-a826ca928a12"
      }'
  ```

  ```bash Partial Refund Request
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.nomba.com/v1/checkout/refund \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'accountId: <accountid>' \
      --data '{
        "transactionId": "WEB-ONLINE_C-69923-2e102708-ee34-4a29-b713-a826ca928a12",
        "amount": 5000.00
      }'
  ```

  ```bash Transfer Refund Request
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.nomba.com/v1/checkout/refund \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'accountId: <accountid>' \
      --data '{
        "transactionId": "WEB-ONLINE_C-69923-2e102708-ee34-4a29-b713-a826ca928a12",
        "amount": 5000.00,
        "accountNumber": "0123456789",
        "bankCode": "058"
      }'
  ```

  ```json Response
    {
      "code": "00",
      "description": "Success",
      "data": {
        "success": true,
        "message": "Refund processed successfully"
      }
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Important Considerations

### Card Refund Timing

<Note>
  Card refunds typically take **T+7 days** (7 business days) for fulfillment. The actual time may vary depending on the customer's card issuer and their processing times.
</Note>

### Vendor Limitations

Some card vendors and issuers do not support automated refunds through their systems. In such cases, the refund request may fail or require manual intervention.

### Recommended Approach

<Tip>
  For **faster and more reliable refunds**, we recommend using the **bank transfer method** by providing the customer's account number and bank code. This ensures immediate processing and avoids potential vendor limitations.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. **Verify Before Refunding**: Always verify that the original transaction was successful before processing a refund.

2. **Keep Records**: Store refund transaction IDs and responses for reconciliation and customer support purposes.

3. **Communicate with Customers**:
   - For card refunds, inform customers about the T+7 days processing time
   - For transfer refunds, confirm the account details are correct before processing

4. **Use Transfer for Urgent Refunds**: When customers need immediate refunds, use the bank transfer method instead of card refunds.

5. **Handle Partial Refunds Carefully**: Ensure the refund amount does not exceed the original transaction amount.
