# Wordpress
Nomba WooCommerce gateway allows you to accept local and international payments. When you integrate this plugin, you can explore [**WordPress subscription options**](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) to process recurring payment when your customer subscribe.

To integrate into any Nomba service, you need to authenticate with our product. This is the same with the WooCommerce plugin; therefore, you will need to obtain your [Nomba API keys here](/getting-started/dashboard-setup#get-your-api-key). This key will allow you to seamlessly integrate with any of our plugins.

<Note>
  This plugin is meant to be used by merchants in Nigeria.
