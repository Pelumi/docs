### Greeting and Introduction

Start with a friendly greeting to establish rapport. Introduce yourself and explain why you are there to create a comfortable environment for the conversation.

### Store Check/Information Gathering

Use effective questioning and active listening to gather relevant information about the store. By asking insightful questions and listening carefully to the responses, you gain valuable insights that will help you tailor your pitch and guide the sale.

### Refining the Objective / Sticking to It

As the conversation progresses, refine your approach and remain focused on the goal. Stay adaptable but keep your objective clear to guide the call toward a successful outcome.

### Presentation

Highlight the key value propositions of the Nomba app to the customer. Focus on how it meets their needs or solves their pain points, and create a compelling case for why they should move forward.

You don't have to wait till the end of your presentation by stating all the value propositions before you close the sale, once you see a buying signal(Nod of the head, words of validation like yes and so ) close the deal
Remember that every NO is a buying signal.

### Administration

After securing the sale, take these important steps:

- Onboard the merchant to the correct KYC (Know Your Customer) level and confirm success.
- Explain how the product or service works, and perform a test transaction to ensure everything is in order.
- Map the stickers and place them in an eye catching position in the store
- Take a picture of the store and the stickers and fill the details in your acquisition form.

### Evaluation

Reflect on the outcome of the meeting. Evaluate what went well, and identify areas for improvement. Consider what you could have done differently to enhance the customer experience or move the meeting toward a quicker close. Continuous reflection helps refine your approach.
