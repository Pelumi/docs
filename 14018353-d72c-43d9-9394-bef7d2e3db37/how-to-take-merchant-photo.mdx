<Tip>Ensure the photo is clear and well-lit</Tip>

## One Wide Shot of Shop and Shopowner

Capture a wide-angle shot of the shop and the shopowner. Ensure good lighting and the shopowner should be clearly visible standing near the entrance of the store.

## One Wide Shot of Shop Sign

Take a clear photo of the shop's sign to help identify the business. The shot should capture the full sign, ensuring that the text is legible and the shop's branding is visible. Aim for an angle where the sign is well-lit, and avoid any obstructions like trees, street signs, or people blocking the view.

## One Shot of Product or Service

Showcase the merchant's key product or service in a clear and focused shot. For physical products, arrange them neatly and consider a close-up to highlight details. For services, consider a photo that shows the merchant in action, such as serving a customer, working on a product, or interacting with clients. Make sure the photo is high quality and represents the product or service in an appealing way.

## Make sure shot is in focus

Always preview your shot to confirm everything is in focus before snapping the picture. If necessary, adjust the framing or focus until you're satisfied with the clarity of the image.
