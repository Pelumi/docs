To initiate the setup, proceed by adding your webhook URL and the corresponding signature key. Additionally, carefully select the events you wish to monitor. For a comprehensive understanding of available webhook events, refer to the [Webhooks documentation](/products/webhooks/introduction).

<Tip>
Before inclusion, we perform a validation check on the webhook URL to ensure it is ready to accept HTTP RESTful POST calls. Please ensure your webhook URL is prepared for seamless integration.

<Tip>
It's crucial to remember your Signature Key, as it plays a vital role in the signature verification process, especially when generating an HMAC signature.
</Tip>

Once you have successfully subscribed to events via your webhooks, your dashboard will reflect the configured events. Take care to subscribe to the appropriate events to tailor your webhook functionality to your specific needs.
