## Introduction

Nomba provides a checkout plugin and SDK to accept payment in your Shopify store. We support Visa, Verve, and Mastercard. You can also receive payment via USSD, bank transfers, and the Nomba QR.Â To integrate into any Nomba service, you need to authenticate with our product. This is the same with our plugins and SDKs; therefore, you will need to obtain your [Nomba API keys here](/getting-started/dashboard-setup#get-your-api-key).

<Note>
  This plugin is meant to be used by merchants in Nigeria.
