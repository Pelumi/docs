## Overview
In the event of a failed card payment on Nomba Checkout, your customer may initiate a dispute through their bank. Subsequently, a dispute is raised against your account, necessitating resolution within a 24-hour timeframe. Failure to address the dispute promptly will result in the automatic debiting of your wallet for the transaction amount.

#### Manual Dispute Resolution
Take control of the dispute resolution process by navigating to the Disputes section of your Nomba dashboard. Here, you can actively manage and address disputes raised against your account.
