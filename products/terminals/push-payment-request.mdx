This integration enables you to initiate payments directly on a Nomba physical payment terminal from your backend system. It allows seamless coordination between your client, server, and a Nomba terminal for in-person payments.

### Flow Description

1. **Customer Orders an Item**  
   The customer initiates a purchase through your client application.

2. **Client Sends Order to Server**  
   Your frontend sends the order details (including `orderId`, `amount`, and `currency`) to your backend.

3. **Server Sends Payment Request to Nomba**  
   Your backend uses the `POST /v1/terminals/payment-request/{terminalId}` endpoint to trigger a payment on the specific terminal.

   #### Endpoint: `POST /v1/terminals/payment-request/{terminalId}`

   **Request Body Schema**: `TerminalPaymentRequest`

   ```json
   {
     "merchantTxRef": "55555555",
     "amount": 1000,
     "currency": "NGN"
   }
   ```

4. **Nomba Pushes Payment to Terminal**  
   The terminal receives a payment prompt and displays the amount to the customer.

5. **Customer Makes Payment on Terminal**  
   The customer completes the payment using a supported payment method.

6. **Nomba Sends Webhook to Your Server**  
   Upon successful payment, Nomba sends a webhook to your server with the payment confirmation and metadata.

## Webhook Notification

Your server must be able to receive webhook notifications from Nomba. Ensure your webhook endpoint is secured and reliable.
