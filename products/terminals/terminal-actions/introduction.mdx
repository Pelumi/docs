Terminal action allows developers to insert custom decision making logic to extend Nomba Terminal features behaviour during different transaction scenarios. 

Imagine your terminal is about to:

• Check balance

• Make a payout

• Perform another financial action

Instead of instantly completing the action, Terminal action pulse the process, send the transaction data to your backend system and wait for your system's approval to either reject or continue the process. After your system's instruction(based on your business rule) it sends a response back to the terminal to:

• Proceed with the transaction  

• Modify some parameters  

• Cancel or reject the action  


Think of it as **middleware for your terminal** — it gives your infrastructure control over what happens next in real time.

## Terminal Actions Scenarios

Terminal actions can be triggered at different stages of a transaction to allow custom business logic to run before proceeding. Below are examples of supported scenarios, their action precedence, types, and execution modes.

| **Scenario**       | **Action Type**             | **Mode**      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| **Payout**         | `pre-payout-auth`           | Synchronous   |
| **Balance Check**  | `pre-balance-check-auth`    | Synchronous   |

<Note>
**Synchronous Mode**:  
In synchronous mode, the terminal will wait for your backend to respond before moving forward with the transaction.

## Precedence

1. `pre-payout-auth`:  Triggered when a user is about to initiate a payout transaction, immediately after the terminal requests a PIN. This allows you to validate the transaction, apply rules, or reject it before processing.

2. `pre-balance-check-auth`: Triggered when a user attempts to check their wallet or account balance. This provides an opportunity to authorize or restrict access based on custom logic.
