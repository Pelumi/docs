---

This section documents the available endpoints for managing, monitoring, and re-pushing webhooks. These tools are useful for diagnosing webhook delivery issues and manually retrying failed requests.

<Info>
  Re-push is especially useful when your webhook endpoint was temporarily unreachable or rejected the payload. This ensures no events are lost during transmission failures.
</Info>

## Workflow

1. Start by using **Get Webhook Delivery Logs** to find failed requests.

2. Retrieve the `hooksRequestId` from those logs returned when you query **Get Webhook Delivery Logs** endpoint.

3. Use Re-push for single retries or Bulk Re-push for multiple retries.

4. Use **Get Customer Events** to confirm webhook setup.


## Get Webhook Delivery Logs

Fetch webhook delivery logs for a specific customer. These logs show attempts, response codes, payloads, and more.

```bash
curl https://api.nomba.com/v1/webhooks/event-logs
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-X POST
-d {
        "coreUserId": "01a10aeb-d989-460a-bbde-XXXXXXXXX",
        "limit": 3,
        "eventType": "payment_success",
        "startDateTime": "2025-03-03",
        "endDateTime": "2025-03-12"
   }
```

## Re-push 

Re-send a previously attempted webhook using the `hooksRequestId`.

```bash
curl https://api.nomba.com/v1/webhooks/re-push \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "hooksRequestId": "02517904-fe58-47eb-83b8-677372f564bf"
  }'
```

## Bulk Re-push

Retry multiple webhooks by passing an array of `hooksRequestIds`.

```bash
curl https://api.nomba.com/v1/webhooks/bulk-re-push \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "hooksRequestIds": [
      "02517904-fe58-47eb-83b8-677372f564bf",
      "1cf4099d-8e3b-4d17-8354-b984df3a9e53"
    ]
  }'
```

##  Get Customer Webhook Events

Fetch the list of webhook event subscriptions registered for a specific customer.

```bash
curl https://api.nomba.com/v1/webhooks/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "coreUserId": "01a10aeb-d989-460a-bbde-984XXXXXXXX",
    "limit": 20
  }'
```
