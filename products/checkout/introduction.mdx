## How Nomba Checkout Works
In addition to its core functionality as a payment gateway, Nomba Checkout distinguishes itself by offering a robust API. This API empowers customers to build customized checkout payment links tailored to their specific needs. Businesses can leverage this feature to create a seamless and integrated payment experience for their customers. By utilizing the Nomba Checkout API, businesses gain the flexibility to adapt payment processes to their unique requirements, enhancing efficiency and providing a tailored payment solution for their customer base.

The provided diagram illustrates the sequence of events in a payment processing flow involving your customer, your application, and Nomba. This sequence ensures a secure and streamlined payment processing flow, demonstrating the interactions between the customer, app, and Nomba at various stages.

The process begins with authentication, followed by the generation of a checkout link, and concludes with payment acceptance and transaction verification. 

### Authentication
The process kicks off with your app communicating with Nomba to generate an access token by making a `POST` call to `/auth/token/issue` ([Authentication](/nomba-api-reference/authenticate/obtain-access-token)). Upon successful authentication, the Nomba API will respond with a success message containing the access token.

### Checkout Link Generation
Your app proceeds to generate a checkout link by making a `POST` call to `/checkout/order` ([Create checkout order](/nomba-api-reference/online-checkout/create-an-online-checkout-order)). The Nomba API responds with a success message containing the checkout link, which your app will display to the customer for them to make payment.
Besides the mandatory fields when creating a checkout order, the various optional fields allow for a number of customizations while creating a checkout order.

#### Create Checkout Order to Tokenize a card
For the purpose of recurrent or subscription payment, while creating the order set the optional parameter `tokenizeCard` to true. This will cause the
checkout service to save the customer's payment details securely and enable you to charge the merchant in the future.

#### Create Checkout Order for a sub/outlet account
When creating a checkout order, specifying the optional field `accountId` will have the checkout funds paid into whatever account is provided in this field.
Note this has to be one of your outlet accounts with Nomba. This will enable you process checkout transactions for different sub accounts.

#### Split settlement
Checkout service allows you to receive payment into multiple accounts you specify. This allows you to specify and amount or percentage of the order value to the settled in specific amounts.
To enable this feature, pass the optional `splitRequest` parameter when creating the checkout order. This will contain how the order amount will be split (by Percentage of the order Amount, or based on actual amount), and the various accounts where the funds will be split into.
Set `PERCENTAGE` for percentage split or `AMOUNT` for monetary amount split in the splitType property.
Note that if the transaction fee will be paid by you, the fee will be deducted from your primary account.



### Payment Acceptance
The customer, using the checkout link, initiates the payment process, choosing to pay with a card or bank transfer.
Nomba sends a webhook notification to your app, signaling the completion of the payment.

### Transaction Verification:
Your app processes the webhook notification and proceeds to verify the transaction by making a `POST` call to `/transactions/accounts` ([Filter Transactions](/nomba-api-reference/transactions/filter-account-transactions)) on Nomba, using the transaction reference. The Nomba API responds with a success message containing transaction details.
